"""
In order to use this script, you must first save each unique page from your SquareSpace website. You can do
this on a Mac by pressing command-s. 
Make sure you save each page in its own folder, aka save your "about" page in a folder called "about". You
don't need to worry about the name of the .html file itself. When you save a webpage in the format 
"webpage, complete" it should create a folder of all the files from the page, including images and JS/CSS.
Once you've saved each webpage to its own folder, put them all into a parent folder, and copy this script
to be in the same parent folder, and then execute it.

Example run:
cd ~/parent_folder
python SquareSpace.py
>What is your website called? Include the https://, please!
https://example.github.io/
>What is the link to your favicon? give full url if not a local file. E.g. "/images/favicon.png".
https://example.github.io/images/favicon.png
>writing ./index.html
>writing ./contact/index.html
>writing ./leadership/index.html
>writing ./read-me/index.html
>writing ./work-experience/index.html
>done
